    <h3>A Brief History of Our Family and Company:</h3>
    <p class="text-shadow">Harold Wade started working as an arborist in the early 1900's. He had 9 sons. Our dad, Buster, worked with his dad who taught him everything from planting and maintenance, to safe removal and disposal.</p>
    <p><img src="images/interface/footer-1945.jpg" class="box-shadow" width="200" height="135" alt="1945"><span class="text-shadow">Fast forward to 1945. Buster is now 22 and has been cutting trees since the late 30's. It was this year that he and his eight brothers began working together to clear the green mountains of Vermont. There would be no power in some areas of Vermont if they hadn't cleared the way for new powerlines. You could say that he was one of the <em>original</em> Axe Men!</span></p>
    <p><img src="images/interface/footer-buster.jpg" class="box-shadow" width="200" height="135" alt="Buster"><span class="text-shadow">In 1977 our dad decided that he was going to try to start a business doing what he loves to do. With that, Wades Tree Service and Company was born. His first employees were all third generation arborists. They were also his sons, Bart, Bret and Brian. Together they served the Greater New York Area as a family owned and operated full service tree company.</span></p>
    <p class="text-shadow">In the early 2000's Bret took over the company and has been running it ever since. He employs a few fourth generation arborists; His son, Tony and his nephews, Brandon and Dillon. They currently work throughout New York's Capital Region for all its tree service needs. What can we do for YOU?</p>
